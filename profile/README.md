# Welcome to the UCLR HyperMile! 

Our team is a group of driven students passionate about green racing.
We compete in the prestigious Shell Eco-marathon, one of the world’s leading student engineering competitions focused on energy optimisation.
Our mission is to push the boundaries of fuel efficiency, we won the 1st Place of the Carbon Footprint Reduction Award in 2024, in addition to the Data and Telemetry Award in 2023!
We are looking for talented students at UCL, across all year groups and departments, to build HyperMile’s next generation hydrogen-powered car for future competitions.
